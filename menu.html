      <p>I find your lack of faith disturbing. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?</p> <p>You mean it controls your actions? No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip; I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Don't underestimate the Force.</p> <p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I call it luck.</p> <p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p> <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>
